Implemented the skeleton of the program.

Created the MathVec class for vector operations. Implemented the stub
methods in the Boid class for GUI testing purposes. MainUI and SimMap is
still work-in-progress.

The MathVec class is the only class which is working smoothly. The MainUI and 
SimMap is almost working. The only problem is that the boids don't move at all.

The workload is roughly 10 hours.

The project is estimated to be ahead of the schedule as the GUI, the part that
the most time-intensive, is almost completed.

Program is near completion. It's almost fully usable at this point.

The simulation works well despite minor twitching from the boids. It can now 
be loaded and saved by clicking the "File" button in menu.

MainUI is the only thing still in progress. Functionalities such as changing
simulation speed or adjusting the properties of simulation will be implemented.

The workload is roughly 40 hours.

The project is estimated to be ahead of the schedule as there are only a few
other minor methods to be implemented.
